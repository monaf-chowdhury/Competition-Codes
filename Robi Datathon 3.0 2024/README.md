This is the folder for Robi Datathon 3.0 (2024). There were three problems. Each problem descriptions are given at the beginning of the solutions. 

Solutions to the three problems are given in the `Problem one.ipynb`, `Problem two.ipynb`, and `Problem three.ipynb` files 
Problem one, two, and three were solved using **`Active Learning`** approach. Although problem one's solution performed really well due to `active learning`, problem two needed more of a statistical analytical approach. So, take the solution for problem two with a grain of salt.  

*Ps: As the competition was private. I can't provide the dataset. :)*  
---- 
Problem one: User need to predict which of the Magic Keys given in “problem 1.csv” will buy milk and/or meat in the first 15 days of March-2019. Put Y in the purchase column if the Magic Keys will purchase and N if the Magic Keys will not make a purchase. 
Position: 6th out of 240 

----
Problem two: Magic Keys given in “problem 2.csv” purchased only one box of milk and/or meat in the first 15 days of March-2019. User need to predict which boxes were purchased by these customers in this period. 

----
Problem three: “problem 3.csv” contains the Magic Keys of customers who purchased at least one box of milk and/or meat in the first 15 days of March-2019. User need to predict what quantity of meat were be purchased by them in this period.
